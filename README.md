# OS_COURSE_PROJECT

Problem Statement: 

Implement the following algorithms in C or C++ without using existing/predefined classes. 

i. LRU - Counter Method
ii. LRU - Stack Method
iii. LRU - Aging Register Method
iv. Apprx. LRU - Clock Method

Compare the contrast the results by testing the algorithms with different corner cases. 

Draw the graph for the number of frames vs. the number of page faults. 

Draw the graph for the average time taken to execute the algorithms for different corner cases. 

Perform the complexity analysis.

Write your comments/critical analysis/study report on your results and complexity.
