LRU_counter.cpp 	-> 	time complexity= O(Total number of frames * size of page stream ) i.e. O(f*p)
LRU_Stack.cpp 		-> 	time complexity= O(Total number of frames * Page Faults ) i.e. O(f*p_f) (conisdering unordered_map performance ot be O(1))
App_LRU_Clock_Algo.cpp	->	time complexity= O((frames + additional_cost) * size of page stream ) i.e. O((f+s_c)*p) (additional cot for maintaing the clock and giving 2nd chance
